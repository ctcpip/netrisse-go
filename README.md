# netrisse
a network version of tetris for the console/terminal

## state of the project
__netrisse is in heavy development and not yet ready for end users__

### roadmap
1. single player mode
2. two-player networked mode
3. three-player networked mode (...maybe)

### inspiration
I started this project in order to teach myself __[Go](http://golang.org)__. __code reviews are most welcome.__ please let me know what could be done better!

netrisse is a clone of __[netris](https://web.archive.org/web/20070215202226/http://portsmon.freebsd.org/portoverview.py?category=games&portname=netris)__, itself a clone of tetris. as such, the gameplay might contain some variations in regard to your expectations.
